# ECommerceBackendE-Commerce Backend System
This project is an e-commerce backend system designed with a layered architecture approach, using Java, ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), JPA (Java Persistence API), and Hibernate. The system is structured to manage and organize complex software projects by dividing the application into distinct layers, each responsible for specific aspects of the application functionality.

## Layered Architecture
The layered architecture model enhances maintainability and scalability by separating concerns into the following layers:

- Presentation (Controller) Layer: Manages the user interface and interactions. In web applications, it involves technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while desktop applications might use Java-based interfaces. This layer handles user inputs, validates them, and forwards them to the Business layer.

- Business Layer: Governs core functionalities and business rules. It responds to requests from the Presentation layer, performs data operations, and prepares outcomes for either the user or the Data Access layer.

- Data Access (Repository) Layer: Communicates with databases or other data sources, managing database transactions, transferring data to the Business layer, and handling errors.

## Additional Components
- Configuration Layer: Contains various configuration settings such as database connections, security settings, and logging. This layer might also include the setup for tools like Swagger for easier endpoint management.

- DTO (Data Transfer Object) Layer: Used for transferring and presenting data objects, especially in formats not aligned with database tables like JSON or XML, facilitating client-server data exchange.

- Exceptions Layer: Includes custom exception classes managed by the application for handling error scenarios, improving error control across layers.

- Model Layer: Contains the application's business logic and data model, including database operations, data validation, and business rules.

- Repository Layer: Deals with database operations like data insertion, retrieval, updates, and deletions.

- Service Layer: The core layer containing business logic. It implements business rules, performs data access operations, and executes various functionalities. This layer is crucial for adding functionality to the project, with its services being called by the API layer.

## Configuration and Management Files
- application.properties: A configuration file used in Spring Boot applications for defining application settings.

- pom.xml: The Maven configuration file for managing project dependencies, plugins, and additional build configurations.

## Annotations Used
@Entity, @Table, @Id, @GeneratedValue, etc., for defining the database entities and their mappings.
@AllArgsConstructor, @NoArgsConstructor, @Data, for simplifying data model creation with Lombok.
@Service, @Repository, @Controller, @RestController, for marking service, repository, controller classes, and RESTful controllers.
@RequestMapping, @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @Autowired, for request mapping, method-specific request handling, and dependency injection.

## ORM, JPA, and Hibernate
- ORM: A programming technique that maps object-oriented domain models to relational databases, serving as a bridge and standardizing database interactions.
- JPA: The Java standard for ORM, facilitating the management of relational data in Java applications.
- Hibernate: A robust JPA implementation that simplifies data persistence and retrieval in Java, making database interactions more efficient.

## Getting Started
### To set up and run the project:

- Clone the repository.
- Ensure Java and Maven are installed on your machine.
- Configure the application.properties file with your database and other environment settings.
- Run mvn clean install to build the project and install dependencies.
- Start the application through your IDE or command line.
